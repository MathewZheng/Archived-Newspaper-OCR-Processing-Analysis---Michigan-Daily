# Newspaper-OCR-Project
Welcome to my project! I worked on this to be applied to the Michigan Daily, to be used to reformat old newspapers in the archives into the more modern format we use for online media. To accomplish this, I used Pytesseract, as well as OpenCV and Pillow for preprocessing the images of the archived newspapers and to morph it to make it more readable for the OCR algorithm. 

The Image Preprocessing Process is Displayed Below:
